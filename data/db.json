      "body": "Imagine your team spending more time making great content and less time dealing with administrative hassles (like budgeting for individual assets and tracking usage permissions for each one). Sounds like a win, right? Our business license has you covered with millions of 100% royalty-free stock assets that you can use worldwide in perpetuity.\n\nAnd sure, some people may actually enjoy blindly guessing thoughtfully estimating all of their stock download costs for the entire year. Others might get a kick out of forecasting every potential distribution channel for their content before a project kicks off. Some may even love those deep, heartfelt conversations with their CFO about “budget predictability.” (AKA: “The Talk.”) To those people, we’re sorry. For the rest of you, our business license provides a simple solution: A subscription for unlimited downloads from our entire library. Leave paying for individual assets and tracking their discrete terms and conditions to your competition. You’ve got content to create!",
